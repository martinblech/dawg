{"name":"Dawg","tagline":"OS X client for Google Hangouts","body":"# Dawg\r\nDawg is a OS X client for Google Hangouts. But unlike most other clients, it does not use any of Google's APIs, but is basically a single-site browser that injects a little CSS and JS into `plus.google.com/hangouts` to make it a little more app-like.\r\n\r\nDawg is a fork of Daniel BÃ¼chele's excellent [Goofy](https://github.com/danielbuechele/goofy).\r\n\r\n## Feature requests and contributing\r\nFeel free to create issues on this repo for feature requests of any kind. However, some features may not be possible due to the way this application is working. Also, I don't want this to be a feature bloated monster, but a slick and small app.\r\n\r\nDepending on the number of contributors and the progress of this app, I will schedule releases from time to time, which will then be distributed on `martinblech.github.io/dawg` and via Sparkle.\r\n\r\n## This repo\r\nThis repo contains the Swift project which is only a small browser and should be pretty self-explanatory.\r\n\r\nBut it also contains the JS and CSS that is loaded from the server. To compile it run:\r\n```\r\nnpm install gulp -g\r\nnpm install\r\ngulp\r\n```\r\n\r\nYou can modify Dawg's `Info.plist` and enter a string value for `DawgJavaScriptURL` to load the JavaScript from a different URL.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
